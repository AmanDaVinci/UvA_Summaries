\section{Probabilistic graphical models}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is often beneficial to visualize a probabilistic model as a diagram, which we call \textit{(probabilistic) graphical models}. 
	\item They are good for:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item causal reasoning/modeling
		\item calculating inference and conditional distributions efficiently 
		\item Designing and communicating statistical model
		\item Encoding independence relations
	\end{itemize} 
	\item Note that there are often multiple ways to express the same probability distribution. For example, take a joint distribution $p(A,B,C)$, which we can either write as $p(A,B,C)=p(A)p(B|A)p(C|A,B)$ (see Figure~\ref{}) or $p(A,B,C)=p(C)p(A|C)p(B|A,C)$ (see Figure~\ref{}). Nevertheless, what we interested in the end is the graphical representation with the least number of edges, as e.g. if $A$ and $B$ are independent, we can drop the edge between those.

	\item We distinguish between directed acyclic graphs, which we call \textit{Bayesian networks} (BN), and undirected graphs, which are \textit{Markov Random Fields} (MRF)
